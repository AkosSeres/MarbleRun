# [MarbleRun](https://akosseres.github.io/MarbleRun/)
Basic 3D rigid body physics simulation with spheres and arbitrary static geometry, demo running in the browser available [here](https://akosseres.github.io/MarbleRun/)!  
Controls:  
* WASD: move forwards/left/backwards/right
* Space: move upwards
* Left shift: move downwards
* Mouse: look around
* Mouse left button: "shoot" a ball
* Escape: release mouse lock
* R: remove all balls from the scene
* T: stop/start time
* P: save the current scene into a file with name *saved.scene* (only works in the native build)  

Additional scenes can be found in the folder called *scenes*. The scenes downloaded from this folder can be opened by drag-and-dropping one into the browser window while the app is running.
